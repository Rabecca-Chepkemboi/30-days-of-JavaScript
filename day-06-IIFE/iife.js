// Create a counter using an IIFE. The counter should start at 1 and increment by 1 each time it is called.
// The counter value should be logged to the console.


// Write an IIFE that accepts an array of numbers as an argument and returns the average of those numbers.


// Implement a module using an IIFE that exposes a public method to calculate the 
// factorial of a given number. The module should also have a private variable 
// to keep track of the number of times the factorial method is called.


// Create a function using an IIFE that generates a random number between 1 and 10, inclusive,
// each time it is called. The generated random number should be logged to the console.
